### What is lavaan?

The lavaan package is developed to provide useRs, researchers and teachers a free open-source, but commercial-quality package for latent variable modeling. You can use lavaan to estimate a large variety of multivariate statistical models, including path analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling and growth curve models.

### First impression

To get a first impression of how lavaan works in practice, consider the following example of a SEM model. The figure below contains a graphical representation of the model that we want to fit.
![](/figures/sem.png){fig-alt="lavaan example" width="70%"}

This is the corresponding lavaan model syntax:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
myModel <- ' 
 # latent variables 
   ind60 =~ x1 + x2 + x3 
   dem60 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 
   dem65 =~ y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 
 # regressions
   dem60 ~ ind60 
   dem65 ~ ind60 + dem60 
 # residual covariances 
   y1 ~~ y5
   y2 ~~ y4 + y6 
   y3 ~~ y7 
   y4 ~~ y8
   y6 ~~ y8
'
fit <- sem(model = myModel, 
           data = PoliticalDemocracy) 
summary(fit)
```
